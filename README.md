# wifitui ðŸ›œâœ¨

`wifitui` is a fast, featureful, and friendly replacement for `nmtui`.

## Features

- [x] **Works with NetworkManager over dbus**
- [x] Show all saved and visible networks
- [x] Fast fuzzy search (`/` to start filtering)
- [x] Show passphrases of known networks
- [x] QR code for sharing a known network with your phone
- [x] Join new and hidden networks (`c` and `n` keys)
- [x] Initiate a scan (`s` key)
- [x] Multiple backends (experimental `iwd` and darwin support, untested)
- [x] Non-interactive modes (`list` `show` `connect` commands)
- [x] Bring your own color scheme and theme (`--theme=./theme.toml` or set `WIFITUI_THEME=./theme.toml`)

More things I'd like to do:
- [ ] More stats about the current network
- [ ] Maybe a better name?

## Getting Started with Nix

This project is packaged for Nix. You can build and install it using the provided Nix expression.

### Building and Installing

To build and install `wifitui`, you first need to update the `sha256` and `vendorHash` in `nix/default.nix`.

1.  Run `nix-build nix`. This command will fail, but it will output the correct `sha256` hash for the source code.
2.  Copy the `sha256` hash into the `sha256` field in `nix/default.nix`.
3.  Run `nix-build nix` again. This time, it will fail with a message about the `vendorHash`.
4.  Copy the `vendorHash` into the `vendorHash` field in `nix/default.nix`.
5.  Run `nix-build nix` one more time. This will build the package and create a `result` symlink in the current directory.

To install the package into your Nix profile, run:

```shell
nix-env -f nix -i
```

### Development

You can use `nix-shell` to create a development environment with all the necessary dependencies.

```shell
nix-shell nix
```

This will drop you into a shell where you can run `go build` to build the project.

## Why not `nmtui` or `impala`?

Each has features the other lacks: `nmtui` can reveal passphrases but can't trigger a rescan, `impala` can rescan but can't manage saved networks (partly due to being iwd-exclusive), etc. I used both for a while, but I just wanted one tool that does everything, plus sort by recency, fuzzy filtering, QR code for sharing the network, support multiple backends (nm and iwd), and more.
