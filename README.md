# wifitui ðŸ«£

Cute wifi TUI that can:
- [x] List all known networks
- [x] Fuzzy search for known networks
- [x] Show current network
- [x] Show passphrases of known networks
- [x] Works with dbus and nm-applet
- [ ] Show non-known visible networks
- [ ] Connect to new networks
- [ ] Initiate a scan

More things I'd like to do:
- [ ] Refactor to support multiple backends (iwd?)
- [ ] macOS support maybe for fun?
- [ ] Non-interactive modes
- [ ] More stats about the current network
- [ ] QR code for sharing a known network?
- [ ] Maybe a better name?
